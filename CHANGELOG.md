# [2.0.0](https://github.com/ciriousjoker/nTradeAdvance/tree/2.0.0) - 2025-07-25

The original version was written in c, but it was a bit of a mess.
Therefore, I eventually couldn't resist rewriting it in Rust with a
completely overengineered and custom "UI framework" inspired by Flutter.

Aside from that, its main feature, ie trading Pok√©mon, is much more stable now due to pkmn-savefile.

Now also supports Mac OS, Linux and Windows because why not...

# [1.0.0](https://github.com/ciriousjoker/nTradeAdvance/tree/1.0) - 2014-07-25
